The team at the Emerging Analytics Center has been very successful at demonstrating the effectiveness and usability of the VDen.

Most recently, we showcased the system to thousands at the 2019 AWE Conference in Santa Clara, California. Marketed as "The Most Essential AR/VR Conference and Expo" by Forbes \cite{aweHomepage}, the expo hosts startups and research projects to showcase their work. We had very good feedback from the users concerning the performance of the system. Several people showed initial interest in purchasing one for their companies and research laboratories. 

The developers at the Emerging Analytics Center were responsible for producing the demo applications shown at these events. These students are accustomed to programming with the HTC Vive headset, so retraining them to work with the VDen was shown to be easy. The primary difference between platforms is the lack of the headset, the input systems are intentionally the same.
