\Chapter{Discussion}\label{chapter:discussionChapter}



In 2011, led by Thomas DeFanti, a team of 25 researchers set out to enumerate the requirements of an ideal CAVE and showcase the systems that have been developed to try and achieve these goals 
\noindent\cite{defanti-future-cave}. They list the  requirements as 


\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\renewcommand\arraystretch{0.5}
	\begin{tabular}{l | l}
		Hardware Requirements &  Software Requirements\\ 
		\hline
		- Compact footprint &  High resolution \\ 
		- Scalability &  Highbrightness and contras\\ 
		- Usability &  Input and full recognition of the viewer’s or viewers’ being and actions \\ 
		- Low noise signature & Audio (sonification) at or exceeding human aural acuity,   \\ 
		- Low thermal signature &  Touch (tactile) input and output\\ 
		- Holds several users  & No user encumbrances (special glasses, headphones, nose tubes)\\ 
		- Network connected & Olfactory (smell) output delivered to each user, \\ 
		- Extended service intervals &  Taste output and input recognition \\
		- easy access for maintenance &  Linking such devices together with near-zero latency\\ 
		- Power-efficient &  \\ 
		- Articulated, easily shippable screens &  \\ 
		- rapid installation/de-installation &   \\ 	
		- low-cost  &   \\ 
	\end{tabular}

	\caption{Enumerates all of the requirements DeFanti's team listed}
\end{table}

The systems presented by the DeFanti et Al try to maximize compliance with the software requirements and a looser authority on the hardware requirements. 

This thesis presented showcases a true CAVE system that fully conforms to the hardware specifications of DeFanti \cite{defanti-future-cave} but also provides additional requirements to emphasize the importance of a floor projector. 

The purpose of this system was to fill in the latest gap of research in Low Cost IPT systems  from 2010 with Dr. Carolina Cruz-Neira to today. The landscape of modern virtual reality has changed, the advent of game engines to ease development and the wave of affordable headsets brings new requirements for a CAVE.

This CAVE system attempted to fully minimize the cost of production by utilizing off the shelf components and freely available software.
